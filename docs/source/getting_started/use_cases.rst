Example use cases
=================

Featuretools is a cross domain framework for feature engineering. It has been used to analyze datasets related to finance, retail, ecommerce, agriculture, education, marketing, and among many others.


**Developer**

You're a developer of popular app whos wants to build data science-based functionality into your product. Using Featuretools, you can spend more building for your users and less time debugging the ins and out of machine learning.


**Data Scientist**

You're a data scientist that is always looking for new features to improve the performance of your models. You use the automated feature engineering in Featuretools to give your model a boost in performance.

**Product Manager**

You're a product manager of growing ecommerce site that wants to use customer behavior data to personalize the user experience. With a large dataset of past actions you can automatically find information rich patterns to describe your customers and build new product features.


**Machine Learning Researcher**

You research algorithms for approaches for dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization, or automl that expect featurized datasets. You could use well known public datasets from `Open ML <https://www.openml.org/>`_, but they aren't as interesting as real world, raw dataset. By using Featuretools you can quickly featurize interesting datasets for your work. Even more, when you publish your work, any user of Featuretools can integrate with your research.
